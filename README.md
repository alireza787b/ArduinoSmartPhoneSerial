# ArduinoSmartPhoneSerial
Example of sending and receiveing command from Smart Phone to Anroid device

For the first Example, I will send 4 PWM Signals from Android Device to an Arduino Mega 2560 via serial. 
I am using Simulink for this tutorial.
What you need to follow the example and the video:

Simulink
Simulink Support Packages for Arduino Board
Simulink Support Packages for Android Devices
Arduino Mega 2560  (can use other board, but should change serial settings)
OTG Module (based on your phone)
an FTDI Module (USB to TTL)
Servo (Optional)
etc

Just follow the youtube video liked below to start this cool project...

This project will be updated with more interesting projects soon.
